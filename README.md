# 🗓️ TimeTabled - Simple Week Planner

**Timetabled** is a grid-style calendar built with React that maps out a one-week schedule with one-hour time blocks from 8 AM to 5 PM. Each event block is color-coded and personalized for a specific recipient—in this version, a fictional or real individual of your choice.
